# 10716-project


In this project, we explored several aspects pertaining to score-based generative modelling. We first, studied loss functions that made score-based matching tractable and amenable to optimization using modern autodiff engines. We then looked into connections between diffusion models and variational inference and finally, examined state-of-the-art mechanisms to sample from these networks.
